      <description>As we gear up for the spring/summer season, I decided to add a touch of lighting to our outdoor patio/deck with some beautiful outdoor patio lights. These patio lighting are super simple to install.
One end of the lights were going to hang from the siding of the house, but I did not have anywhere to hang the other sides. So, off to Home Depot I go, and I bought some really cheap furring wood that matches the furring wood on my deck.</description>

      <description>As spring rolls in, those pesky mosquitoes love to start breeding and making their home in our beautiful yards. They will target yards where there is standing water (untreated pools, creeks, poor drainage, old tires/buckets filled with water, etc). The mosquitoes will hide under the pine straw where it is moist, as well as under the leaves of trees or near their roots.
The mosquitoes tend to move in when the temperatures go above 50F, and start breeding.</description>

      <description>Spring is here, and before the days get too hot here in Atlanta, I wanted to get my fence built. Although tempted to DIY this myself, it is simply way too much work for one person. I have 380 linear feet of fencing required to go around the back of my yard to the sides of my home.
Although I liked the open space in my yard, there are a few reasons I wanted to get a fence.</description>

      <description>If you have made it this far in your home building journey, then you are almost there. There are probably only a few weeks left until the builder has you scheduled to close on your brand new dream home.
In the final days of construction, the builder is likely to have a number of things left to do - such as paint touch ups, flooring, and a few other small fixtures.</description>

      <description>As we start to jump into tech gadgets for the home, one of the first decisions we need to make is if we want to take advantage of a specific ecosystem (Apple vs Google vs Amazon), or try to keep our options open as the major tech companies fight it over. My preference has been to try to stay as universal as possible, while choosing the best tech out there for its purpose.</description>

      <title>DIY Outlet In Drawer</title>

      <description>A must have for any bathroom or kitchen is an outlet in the drawer. It is an incredibly useful DIY to get the hair dryer, or curling/straightening iron off the counter tops, and hidden away in the drawer. But still usable. When you need it, just open the drawer, turn on the switch, and start using it. Likewise, you can install this in your kitchen and then hide your devices in a drawer while they are charging.</description>

      <description>When choosing which builder upgrades you should apply when building your dream home, the most important thing to consider is your budget. You will likely have limitations on what you can afford, and that should be the most important factor which choosing which upgrades to go for.
Once you know what your total budget is (price for base model of home, plus upgrades = your total budget), the next step is to list out all the things you want.</description>

      <description>USB Outlets is really a must have in any home these days. With all of our devices - from iPhones and Androids, to iPads and other tablets, it seems like we are always charging something.
But, when we are charging, I hate having that charging brick sticking out of the wall all the time. I am also always hunting around for a wire, or free outlet in a convenient spot so that I can charge.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 2019 and many of you may still be paying traditional alarm providers for alarm monitoring. But did you know there are many easy DIY options that are in many ways better and cheaper than what you are paying them?
First, let&amp;rsquo;s break down the typical cost.
Basic Monitoring Plans A basic alarm monitoring package (2 door sensors, 1 basic keypad, and 1 motion sensor) is going to typically set you back $30/mo on a 3 year term.</description>

      <title>DIY Drawer Organizer</title>

      <description>This DIY Drawer Organizer was a spur of the moment DIY I came up with. We used to have a store bought wooden organizer a while ago which looked nice, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t sized appropriately for the drawer, and the slats had gaps below them where the silverware would sneak under (this was really annoying). Then recently, my wife went out and replaced it with a new organizer, but it was even smaller and just didn&amp;rsquo;t look good.</description>

      <description>Ever since I started using Pinterest and started discovering images of other peoples homes incorporating Farmhouse elements, I have been in love. And I have sought to replicate many of these ideas in my own home.
Our latest addition to our living room has been this beautiful farmhouse ladder shelf that we purchased from Kohls.

      <description>As the temperatures start to warm up, it&amp;rsquo;s time to start thinking about the growing season. We love to cook at our home, and a fresh batch of herbs on hand is always a life saver. Not to mention we love the smell of fresh herbs around us.
We wanted to have something close to the kitchen so that we could walk out and grab a handful of Thyme or Rosemary whenever we needed.</description>

      <description>This table was not one of my own DIY projects since it was so cheap to just go out and buy. We purchased this entry way console table from our local HomeGoods store for only $60. I probably could have DIY built it myself, but my wife saw this and wanted to get it on the spot.
This entryway console table provides a beautiful visual when our friends visit as it&amp;rsquo;s the first thing they see.</description>

      <description>This is probably my favorite DIY to date at home. I love how gorgeous these shelves turned out, and it only cost me a few hundred dollars.
There are a bunch of guides on Pinterest covering how to do this, but I really wanted to share ours. These shelves have seriously brightened up the office. I work remotely from home, and am constantly in Video Conferences. Having this IKEA shelf idea as a backdrop for those meetings has been a constant point of discussion, as my coworkers love how clean it looks.</description>

      <description>As the weather is warming up, and spring is in the air, its imperative you follow the appropriate lawn maintenance schedule for your lawn. I live in the south (Atlanta to be specific), so the below tips are for the South East region. Many of our lawns have Bermuda grass, so I will be focused on this type of Bermuda grass maintenance.
There are two critical areas to focus on if you want a perfect lawn.</description>

      <description>So a few months ago I purchased a new Tesla Model 3. It&amp;rsquo;s my dream car and I am totally in love with it. We made this our main car, which meant with two kids we have two car seats in the back.
Anyone with kids in will know that for some reason they have to kick the seats in front of them. It&amp;rsquo;s all that energy they have I guess where they can&amp;rsquo;t just sit still.</description>

      <description>Plan out your Outdoor Landscape Lighting Design So, how did I DIY install my Outdoor Landscape Lighting?
Start by planning out what you want your landscape lighting design to entail.
 Where do you want up lights to light up your home? What garden features do you want to highlight? What obstacles will get in the way of wiring? Do you want down lights?  If so, do you have a way to hide the cable through the gutters/down spouts?</description>

      <description>Hi DIYers. Welcome to my latest post on DIY projects. This is one of the first projects I ever completed at home and inspired me to do many more since then. Our home came equipped with two locations for the laundry room. The standard one was downstairs behind the kitchen in what I consider to be a massively oversized room for a laundry. But, we also asked the builder to equip one of the closets upstairs to be a laundry room, which he happily obliged.</description>

      <description>When building a new home (or even buying one that is already standing), you will want to go through our free home building checklist to ensure you are considering everything you need in the layout of your home.
Sometimes, a builder may already have a model home that you can walk through. More often than not, these model homes will be decked out with some of the best upgrades, and will sell you with their beautifully staged furniture.</description>

      <description>Choosing a Location The first thing when scouting for a new home ischoosing a location. Whether you plan to buy a plot of land and have a custom architect design and build for you, or if you plan to go with one of the many neighborhoods built with existing plans by Pulte, DR Horton, or others, the first step is to find a home within the boundaries of your desired location.</description>

      <guid>https://www.drawbuildplay.com/blog/diy-under-cabinet-lighting/</guid>
      <description>One of the things we wanted to do when we built our home was to have under cabinet lighting in our kitchen. Getting this from our builder was going to be $200 per light, and with three sections in our kitchen this would have easily cost us $600 - $1000 depending on how much we got.
After researching some ideas, we decided to install wired puck lights ourselves afterwards. I had the builder install power outlets above the cabinets, connected to a wall switch.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my previous blog post on [Part One - How to stop paying for your landline](https://www.drawbuildplay.com/blog/how-to-cut-the-cord-stop-paying-for-your-landline/), most people pay between $100 and $250 each month to their cable providers. They are paying for Internet, Phone, and TV. My last post showed how you can save at least $20 per month by not paying your cable company for a phone line. Now for the bigger savings. Lets save some money by watching TV for free without cable.</description>

      <description>Many homes are still subscribed to cable. Many are still paying for bundled services like Phone, Internet, and TV. Often, these nasty cable bills are around $200 per month.
Now, what if I told you you didnt need to pay for phone or TV. You can get internet service in most places for between $30 - $100 depending on how fast broadband speeds you want. I currently pay AT&amp;amp;T for their Gigabit Fiber network $70/month.</description>
