<p>If you have made it this far in your home building journey, then you are almost there.  There are probably only a few weeks left until the builder has you scheduled to close on your brand new dream home.</p>

<p>In the final days of construction, the builder is likely to have a number of things left to do - such as paint touch ups, flooring, and a few other small fixtures.</p>

<p>As the buyer, it is your responsibility to make sure the builder has done everything that they promised, and your home is handed over to you in a finished condition.  The builder will want to close (especially before the end of the month or quarter), so they will try to complete many of the requests (within reason) that you make, in order to close.</p>

<p>If there are unfinished items, then you have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Move the closing date to after those items are completed.  Builders will not want to do this, and often it&rsquo;s a hassle for you also as it requires moving mortgage dates (quote may expire), you may have another home you have to move out of, etc.  But, if you have flexibility, this is the strongest way you can ensure the builder completes the job.</li>
<li>The second, and more common, option is to get the list of remaining work in writing and signed by the builder, which they must complete within 30 days of closing.  This will allow you to close per schedule, and start to move in, but the builder may need to come over and finish off those remaining items.</li>
</ol>

<p>Before your final walkthrough with the builder (usually the final week before closing), you will need to carefully inspect your home to ensure it meets your standards.</p>

<p>I recommend paying for a professional home inspector to inspect the structural integrity of your home (they usually wont comment on cosmetic issues though), to ensure everything was built to code (also do this before the drywall goes up).</p>

<p>The following is a compilation of <strong>Building a Home Tips for the final walkthrough</strong>, containing a list of common cosmetic defects you will want the builder to resolve.  Any issues you find during your final walkthrough, make a list on paper, and also mark the location with blue painters tape so the builder can easily locate it.</p>
