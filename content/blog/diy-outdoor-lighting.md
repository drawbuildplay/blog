Installing outdoor lighting around your home is simpler than you think.  My setup at home (pictured below) cost less than $500 all up, compared to professional installers who charge about $2,000 - $3,000 for a similar installation.

How did I do it?

## Plan out your Outdoor Lighting Design

Start by planning out what you want your lighting design to entail.  

* Where do you want up lights to light up your home?
* What garden features do you want to highlight?
* What obstacles will get in the way of wiring?
* Do you want down lights? 
  * If so, do you have a way to hide the cable through the gutters/down spouts?
* Where will you install the transformer?
* Where is the exterior outlet?
* Do you plan to have your Outdoor Lighting connected to a timer or Smart Outlet for automatic scheduling and control?

## Choosing where to install your flood lights

Choosing where to install your flood lights will depend on the look of your home or garden, and what features you want highlighted at night.  A good choice is to start with the various walls of your house.  Are there features that should be highlighted?  Pillars and wall corners are good places to start, and on longer walls you may want to put lights in the middle also.  If you have a garden, then pointing the light source at trees will usually look good.  If you do this, make sure the front of the tree is lit up (rather than putting the light behind the tree).  That way, people looking at your home as they drive past will be able to see the tree/shrub.

## Obstacles

Common obstacles you may face while laying down the wiring is footpaths or driveways.  Thankfully you won't have to dig up that concrete
