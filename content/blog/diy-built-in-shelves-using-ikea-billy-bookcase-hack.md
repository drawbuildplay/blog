This is probably my favorite DIY to date at home.  I love how gorgeous these shelves turned out, and it only cost me a few hundred dollars.

There are a bunch of guides on Pinterest covering how to do this, but I really wanted to share ours.  These shelves have seriously brightened up the office.  I work remotely from home, and am constantly in Video Conferences.  Having these shelves as a backdrop for those meetings has been a constant point of discussion, as my coworkers love how clean it looks.  Not to mention, it adds a bunch of character to the calls instead of a plain wall.

Our library is also the first room visitors see when they enter our home through the front door.  It helps make a beautiful statement entry as their eyes are immediately drawn to the shelves and the various decor items sitting in each space.

We opted to go with a farmhouse look once the shelves were up.  This required finding good deals at a variety of different stores - many of the items from places like At Home, Marshalls/Ross, and Hobby Lobby.  

For the desk, we purchased this beautiful picnic table from World Market.  It even has a hole for the umbrella which can be used to drop the computer wires down.  However, I prefer a clean look (no wires), and I mainly use a laptop, so I instead thread the power cable between the gaps in the wood.

The globe light was also purchased from World Market.  It truly helped round out the library.
