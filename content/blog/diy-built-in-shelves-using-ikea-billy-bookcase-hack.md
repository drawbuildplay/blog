This is probably my favorite DIY to date at home.  I love how gorgeous these shelves turned out, and it only cost me a few hundred dollars.

There are a bunch of guides on Pinterest covering how to do this, but I really wanted to share ours.  These shelves have seriously brightened up the office.  I work remotely from home, and am constantly in Video Conferences.  Having these shelves as a backdrop for those meetings has been a constant point of discussion, as my coworkers love how clean it looks.  Not to mention, it adds a bunch of character to the calls instead of a plain wall.

Our library is also the first room visitors see when they enter our home through the front door.  It helps make a beautiful statement entry as their eyes are immediately drawn to the shelves and the various decor items sitting in each space.
