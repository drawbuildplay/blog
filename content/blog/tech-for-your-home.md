## Programmable Thermostats

If you don't already have a programmable thermostat, then this is a no brainer first gadget you should install in your home.  A programmable thermostat will save you money (often recouping its cost within the first 2 years) because you will be able to control when your HVAC actually needs to run and the temperature desired based on when you actually need it - for example, turn it on when you are at home, off while away, and lower while sleeping.

If you already have a programmable thermostat, then upgrading to an internet connected one is a great smart home choice.  It will let you control your temperature and home/away settings with your smart phone (iPhone/Android), as well as integrate with any voice assistants you have.

The two programmable thermostats I recommend are the Nest Thermostats, and the Ecobee thermostat.

Nest is the leader in this category and redefined the idea of a thermostat - making it cool.  Nest is also better integrated with Google Home.  Ecobee came a few years later, and while in my opinion doesn't look as cool, they have innovated faster than Nest.  Ecobee also integrates with Apple HomeKit, so if you are in the Apple ecosystem and use HomeKit, then Ecobee may be a better fit.

Both thermostats are great in my opinion.

## USB Outlets

Although technically not what is considered a smart internet connected gadget, USB outlets are an incredibly convenient piece of tech to install.  Replace a power outlet in your kitchen, office, or living room where you often find yourself charging gadgets.  A USB outlet makes it incredibly more convenient to charge those USB devices.

## Garage Opener or Smart Locks

Our garage is our main entry/exit point for 95% of the times we leave or return home.  Although we have homelink enabled openers in our car, there are often times we leave the home to go on walks or runs.  An internet connected garage is extremely convenient for this purpose, as it will allow you to open/close the garage from your iPhone or Apple Watch using the MyQ app.  Just purchase the MyQ Homebridge and it will convert your MyQ compatible Liftmaster/Chamberlain garage opener into a connected garage.  You can also set up notifications to your phone every time the garage is opened/closed.  This is helpful to get alerted when a family member returns/leaves home while you are somewhere else.  You can also close the garage from a remote location using your phone/watch if you realize you forgot to close it.  Really cool.

The MyQ Homebridge is also HomeKit enabled, giving you integration into Apple's Homekit.  Integration with Google Home is also available, but unfortunately they charge a monthly subscription for Google.

If your primary access to your home is through your front door, then rather than getting a connected garage opener, a smart lock on your door might be a better investment.  Similar to the MyQ Homebridge, a Smart Lock will allow you to remotely lock/unlock your door, as well as send you alerts.

## Smart Doorbell

Smart Doorbells such as the Ring Doorbell Pro, and Nest Hello are great tech gadgets when it comes to security.  About a third of break-ins happen through the front door.  Homes with Ring or Nest Doorbells have shown a significant decrease in burglaries.  Thieves don't want to be caught on camera, so a smart doorbell acts as both a deterrent and a great security device.

My recommendation here is to go with the Nest Hello.  It has had better feature enhancements compared to the Ring Doorbell.  Also, it has facial recognition and can announce via a Google Home speaker who is at the door when it recognizes the face.  Ring has been around longer with their doorbells, and was recently acquired by Amazon.  They have long promised HomeKit integration with Apple, but that feature has been missing for 3 years now.

## Voice Assistants

No smart home will be complete without a voice assistant.  There are a myriad of assistants to choose from now, primary Google's Assistant, Apple's Siri, or Amazon's Alexa.

Google Assistant is by far the smartest assistant when it comes to voice recognition and quality of answers.  However, for privacy concerns, giving Google so much information about us can be concerning.  

Apple is strongly privacy focused, and your searches and history are not tied to you or stored.  The Apple HomePod Speaker is a great speaker, competing with Sonos in many ways.  Siri is getting stronger by the day and can cover most questions.  If you are tied to the Apple ecosystem, the HomePod is the way to go.  

Amazon Alexa is fairly basic, and their speakers aren't really all that good.  But it is relatively affordable so might be a good entry point to a voice assistant.
