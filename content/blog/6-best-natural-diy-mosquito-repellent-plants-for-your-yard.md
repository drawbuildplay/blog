As spring rolls in, those pesky mosquito's love to start breeding and making their home in our beautiful yards.  They will target yards where there is standing water (untreated pools, creeks, poor drainage, old tires/buckets filled with water, etc).

The mosquito's tend to move in when the temperatures go above 50F, and start breeding.  Once in place, they can be difficult to get rid of.

A common response by home owners is to spray their yard with an insecticide.  I will be honest and I have gone this route before.  Ultimately, I found it to be ineffective as the mosquito's tend to come back after the next rain fall.  More importantly, the insecticides will also harm the more useful insects.

> BEE's!!!!  Don't kill the bee's.  Please!

_Note - if you do decide you don't care much about the bee's and want to spray insecticide anyway, then do so on a calm day, late in the evening, when the bee's have returned to their hives.  Only spray the undersides of leaves, and under any mulch, but don't spray the flowers where the bee's collect their nectar!_

### A Natural Solution to Repel Mosquitos

A natural solution, and one that is long term, is to strategically landscape your garden to discourage mosquito's from invading.

Mosquito's tend to hate strong scented plants (especially herbs).  Meanwhile, these plants will look lovely in your garden, and fill your yard with really pretty scents that we love.  Most of them will also attract bee's and butterflies and hummingbirds.  So it's really a win win all round.

#### 1. Lavender

Lavender is a great repellant to mosquitos and many other invaders (like rabbits, and other insects).  The essential oils that the lavender plant gives off messes with their sense of smell, and they will move on.  The plant grows gorgeous purple flowers, and is very low maintenance.

#### 2. Rosemary

Rosemary is another great mosquito repellent, which like lavender, will emit a beautiful scent that insects and mosquito's despise.  Rosemary is a woody plant, which is also low maintenance and doesn't require a lot of water.   Once established, it will grow back year after year.  You can use rosemary in your cooking as a herb.  You can also shape and prune the rosemary into shapes in your garden to make a great border or decoration.

#### 3. Marigolds

Marigolds are a pretty yellow/red/orange flower that adds some beautiful color in your garden. It is an annual, so it will die out every year when the frost moves in.  But it is very easy to grow every year.  Marigolds will emit a smell that repel mosquitos. In fact, marigolds have significance in hinduism due to its protective power as it repels many insects and pests.

#### 4. Lemon Grass

Notice how many mosquito repellents you apply to your skin has a citrus smell.  Many of these lotions are made from the lemongrass plant.  Citronella Plants are one of the best plants for repelling pests like mosquito's.  In warm sunny climates, these can be planted in the ground.  However it also does not stand up to the frost.

Bee Balm (also known as horsemint) is a great mosquito repelling plant.  It belongs to the mint family, and will bring all sorts of great insects to your yard such as bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds.  All the while repelling annoying insects like mosquitos.  Bee balm will grow fairly tall, so ideally placed towards the back of your garden.  As it is part of the mint family, it can become invasive if not properly controlled over time.
